        "You're experiencing discomfort in your chest area. This could be related to your heart, lungs, or even digestive system. While chest pain can sometimes indicate serious conditions like heart attacks, it can also be caused by muscle strain, anxiety, or acid reflux. It's important to note any additional symptoms like shortness of breath, sweating, or pain radiating to your arm or jaw.\n\nYour heart is a muscular organ about the size of your fist that pumps blood throughout your body. When the blood flow to part of your heart is blocked or reduced, it can cause chest pain (angina) or a heart attack. If you're experiencing severe chest pain, especially with other symptoms like shortness of breath or pain radiating to your jaw or arm, seek medical attention immediately.",

        "You have what's called a herniated disc in your lower back. Think of the discs in your spine as small cushions between your vertebrae (spine bones). When a disc herniates, part of its soft inner material pushes out through a tear in the tougher outer layer. This can irritate nearby nerves, causing pain, numbness, or weakness in your back, buttocks, legs, or feet.\n\nYour spine is made up of 24 bones called vertebrae, stacked on top of each other. Between each vertebra is a disc that acts as a shock absorber. When a disc herniates, it's like squeezing a jelly donut so that some of the jelly comes out. This 'jelly' can press on nerves, causing pain. Most herniated discs occur in the lower back (lumbar spine), but they can also occur in the neck (cervical spine).",

        "A headache is pain or discomfort in your head or face area. There are many types of headaches with different causes. Tension headaches feel like a band tightening around your head and are often caused by stress or muscle tension. Migraines are more severe and may come with nausea or sensitivity to light and sound. They happen when blood vessels in your brain temporarily change size.\n\nYour brain itself doesn't have pain receptors, so it can't actually 'hurt.' The pain you feel during a headache comes from the tissues surrounding your brain, including blood vessels, nerves, and muscles. During a migraine, certain nerves in your brain release chemicals that cause blood vessels to swell and become inflamed, leading to pain. Triggers can include stress, certain foods, lack of sleep, or hormonal changes.",
