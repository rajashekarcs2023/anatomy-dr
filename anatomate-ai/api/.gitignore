aali â€” 4/24/25, 7:01â€¯PM

Waiting to be let in
quincy â€” 4/24/25, 8:03â€¯PM

quincy â€” 4/24/25, 8:38â€¯PM
nice meeting u all! just wondering since u guys mentioned three.js - what tech stack are we thinking of using
or should we just flesh that out tmrw lol
Sultan â€” 4/24/25, 8:52â€¯PM
Typescript will be a must
I have somehow avoided nextjs all my life but thatâ€™s prolly the best
Sultan â€” 4/24/25, 8:59â€¯PM
tech stack tldr:

Either
Nextjs only

OR
If not that choose a backend and a frontend
Backend Options: Python (FastAPI prolly best) or Express
Frontend: React+Vite or Nextjs


Libraries: Threejs (confirmed), rest we do trrw

also @Rajashekar @quincy when and where u guys landing fyi
quincy â€” Yesterday at 6:32â€¯AM
LAX at 4:48pm!
quincy â€” Yesterday at 8:50â€¯AM
u said ur landing at 4 right? how r u gonna get to the venue
Sultan â€” Yesterday at 9:02â€¯AM
Iâ€™m thinking public transport to union station and then uber from there
From what Iâ€™ve heard the direct train to union station is pretty solid speed wise and price of uber basically halves
Sultan â€” Yesterday at 10:19â€¯AM
acc lmk if u wanna travel together or something, i think can find something to do for an hour
quincy â€” Yesterday at 1:44â€¯PM
my flight got a bit delayed cuz of storms in chicago but if u don't mind waiting for like an hour i'd be down
estimated arrival time is 5:05 but i dont have checked-in baggage so i should be out pretty quick
Sultan â€” Yesterday at 1:52â€¯PM
Sure sure Iâ€™ll lyk
Most likely Iâ€™ll prolly grab food at the airport first, skipped breakfast and lunch
And then we leave together
quincy â€” Yesterday at 1:56â€¯PM
yea that's perfect! i actually don't have discord on my phone (forgot my password lol) so if u could text me @ 8723258205 that'd be a lot better haha
also how did u skip both i'd actually be nonfuctional at this point

#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# UV
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include uv.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
#uv.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
#   https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control
#poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#pdm.lock
#   pdm stores project-wide configurations in .pdm.toml, but it is recommended to not include it
#   in version control.
